# CaseGen

CaseGen is a small Ruby gem for generating combinations of variables, optionally
restricted by a set of rules.  

## Usage

The [`doc`](/doc) folder has a few examples demonstrating how you can use this
gem. The [`specs`](/spec) also demonstrate various input and output options.


## Breaking Changes in 3.0

Versions 1 and 2 were based on a DSL format. Version 3.0 removed the DSL 
to just use plain Ruby.
