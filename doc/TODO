- performance problems

    two problems: formatting table is very slow, too many iterations. Sets agent can get
    col widths easy, but it may not be passed to the console agent, so may need to support
    "console(rules, sets)" syntax

    the actual enum product call is fairly quick, but the rules are 3x as slow. Need a way
    to maybe hold off on generating the combinations and then hook in with a block to filter
    them as they're being made - save another run through the whole set.

- support for "assign ... when ..."
- if condition specified has an incorrect value, notify user
- don't require comma AND SPACE in set lists ... ? (This is currently that way to allow thousands separators in values)

- this case:
      exclude Cl = Ser         AND Rec = K12RF(1.01)
      exclude Cl = Ser         AND Rec = G2IR(white)
      exclude Cl = Num         AND Herf(11)

  blows up without a meaningful error

- meaningful exceptions still are exceptions, and you have a full stacktrace - make it purty.
