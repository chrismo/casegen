# Comments supported
exclude shipping = Ground AND ship to country = Outside US
  Our ground shipper will only ship things within the US.

# Single or double equals sign supported - they're synonymous
exclude payment = Check AND bill to country == Outside US
  Our bank will not accept checks written from banks outside the US.

#[Complex booleans not supported yet]
#exclude payment = Online Bank AND (amount == 1,000 OR amount = 10,000)
exclude payment = Online Bank AND amount == 1,000
exclude payment = Online Bank AND amount == 10,000
  While the online bank will process amounts > $1,000, we've experienced
  occasional problems with their services and have had to write off some
  transactions, so we no longer allow this payment option for amounts greater
  than $1,000

exclude ship to country = US AND bill to country = Outside US
  If we're shipping to the US, billing party cannot be outside US
